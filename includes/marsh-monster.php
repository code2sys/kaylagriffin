		<h4>marsh monster challenge</h4>

		<p class="work-desc">The goal of this project was to change the perception of the NRA. To do this, I created a hunting contest in the Florida Everglades where hunters got the change to battle the worlds largest snake (the anaconda) while helping protect the Florida ecosystem from an exotic species.
		<span class="space">This informational piece would be given away to hunters upon registration for the event at hunting conference trade booths.</span>
